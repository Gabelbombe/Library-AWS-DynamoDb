# DynamoDB PHP 5.4+ Wrapper
Access AWS DynamoDB through a much simpler interface.

This module is simpler because:
* The results of each API are mapped to Array object automatically.
* The request exceeding the limit can be sent by dividing into small ones automatically.
* The response exceeding the limit can be fetched by requesting continuously.

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/ehime/DynamoDB-Wrapper/wiki).
